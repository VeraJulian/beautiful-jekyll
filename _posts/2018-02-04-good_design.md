Here we will discuss why this [student body](https://wso.williams.edu/) site and its pages are considered good design.

## Initial design thoughts

Nice straightforward navigation bar that any student can use. There are clear, distinct categories for many purposes. No need
to have overlapping sections.

## Choosing a tab

Again, a nice straightforward navigation bar with an explanation of Dormtrak with quantitative-based rankings of dorms, and a navbar to look at the different neighborhoods.

Consensus from students is that WSO is an example of good design. The experience is pleasurable because the site is very intuitive and easy to use.
There are no ambiguous links or tabs, each category the site provides information for has its own tab, and each page has categories nicely distinguished.
