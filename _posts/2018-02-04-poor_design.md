Here we will discuss why this [nutrition](http://nutrition.williams.edu/) site and its pages are poorly designed.

## Initial design thoughts

The page is not very pleasant to look at, and is quite clumped. Unnecessary instruction: a lot of text may overwhelm users. "Paresky Student Center" under "Places to Eat" is vague and 
should, in fact, specify the various stations within Paresky. The 
[Nutrition Home](http://nutrition.williams.edu/NetNutrition/Home.aspx/StartOver/) tab leads to a blank page. For aesthetic, 
"Places to Eat" could be in a tab bar at the top of the page.

## Choosing a tab

Tabs share redundant information with the 'Daily Menu' option and have no logical ordering. The note at the bottom is not 
needed here, potentially confusing users. Not shown: allergies check boxes at bottom of page, with no functionality.

## Daily Menu

Two back arrows with only one labeled. Having to go back-and-forth just to see the
different meals of the day for only the selected dining hall is quite frustrating - it would be nice to quickly switch between 
dining halls without needing to tart over. Toolbars could really come in handy.

Consensus from students is that the dining services website is poorly designed. It is very frustrating to use because of
confusing navigation. Navigation can be improved with a navbar that contains all dining halls and/or meals. Once a dining hall is selected, 
there will be dropdown menu to select a meal. Once a meal is chosen, all nutrition information will be shown. Switching to another dining
hall should not require going back or completely starting over.
